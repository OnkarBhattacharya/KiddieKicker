## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vibrant blue (#29ABE2) to represent the sky and the energy of the game.
- Background color: Soft, desaturated blue (#D3E2EA), to visually separate elements from the main game, without adding too much emphasis. It will be easy on the eye, but of the same general character as the primary.
- Accent color: Energetic orange (#F08200), an analogous complement to blue, which will pop out in contrast and draw attention.
- Font: 'PT Sans', a friendly and legible sans-serif for all text elements.
- Use colorful, cartoon-style icons for team selection and game controls.
- Design a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes (PC, smartphones, tablets).
- Implement simple, engaging animations for goals, celebrations, and transitions.
